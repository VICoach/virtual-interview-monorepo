The main purpose of this folder is to receive an audio input from the user and provide an audio response from the interviewer.

# Steps

- Receive the audio file.
- Save it temporarily.
- Run STT (Speech-to-Text) on it.
- Send the transcribed text to the agent via WebSocket.
- Receive the AI response.
- Convert the response into speech (TTS).
- Return both the text response and (optionally) a path to the audio file.

# Routes in Use

## 1. /interview/ (POST route)

**Role :**

This route handles the process of accepting an audio file (MP3 format), transcribing it to text using the transcribe_audio function, sending the transcribed text to the AI agent for a response, and returning a streamed TTS (Text-to-Speech) audio of the AI's reply.

## 2. /ws (WebSocket route)

**Role:**

This route is a WebSocket server that handles bidirectional communication between a client and an agent WebSocket. It listens for messages from the client, forwards them to the agent, and sends the agentâ€™s response back to the client. 
It facilitates live communication between the user and the agent without the need for multiple HTTP requests.
